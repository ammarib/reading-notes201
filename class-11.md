* On-Page Techniques   
On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your
web pages to improve their rating in search engines     
* Off-Page Techniques    
Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of
other sites that link to yours.
