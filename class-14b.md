# Building the Perfect effective Team      


* The core of any effective company is the organization of the work of teams to create in a limited time unique,
innovative solutions, methods, technologies, products and services, their improvement and support throughout the entire life cycle of the product.       



* The “right” development team is a team of specialists united by a common goal and solving all the tasks assigned to them throughout the product life cycle.    

 



* Each team member has a key role and a set of core and complementary knowledge. This latter is extremely important for building a highly effective team.      



* The key principles of team formation are the voluntariness of joining the team and focus on results. Each team member performs that part of the overall task that his team has identified with him.
