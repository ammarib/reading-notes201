# STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS  
With HTML5, user data can be saved locally on his personal computer.
Previously, data was stored locally as a cookie, but the use of data storage on the web has become more secure
and faster. The data is not stored in every transmission to the server but only when requested.
It is also possible to store large amounts of data without any impact on website traffic.        

> Web data storage is supported by all browsers.  


## There are two types of data storage objects:   
* localStorage: Stores data with no specified expiration date.   
* sessionStorage: Stores data for a single session.
