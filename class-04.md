# LINKS in HTML
Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.  
Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening < a> tag and the closing < /a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

### Email Links

*mailto* 
 To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the <a>
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.  
 >  < a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon< /a>  
 
 ## Layout
 
 #### Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
 
 Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

## Controll ing the Position of Elements  

 - Normal flow
Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one.
Even if you specify the width
of the boxes and there is space
for two elements to sit side-byside,
they will not appear next
to each other. This is the default
behavior (unless you tell the
browser to do something else).  
- Relative Positioning
This moves an element from the
position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it
would have been placed. This
does not affect the position of
surrounding elements; they stay
in the position they would be in
in normal flow.  
- Ab solute positioning
This positions the element
in relation to its containing
element. It is taken out of
normal flow, meaning that it
does not affect the position
of any surrounding elements
(as they simply ignore the
space it would have taken up).
Absolutely positioned elements
move as users scroll up and
down the page.  

- Floating Elements
Floating an element allows
you to take that element out
of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a
containing box. The floated
element becomes a block-level
element around which other
content can flow.  
### Summary

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.  
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.  
- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.  
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.  
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).  
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.  
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.  
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

# Function methods and objects  
-  Browsers require very detailed instructions about what
we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run
to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
This chapter is divided into three sections that introduce:  
1 Functions and methods  
2 objects   
3 bult-in objects
